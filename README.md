# Todo App

We are building a Todo App together!  At first we will use Rails, and later we will use a combination of Rails and React.

## Setup

* `bundle`
* `yarn`

### Ruby Version

* 2.5 or greater

### System dependencies

* sqlite3, which should already be on your machine

### Database creation

* Not needed for as long as we are using sqlite3

### Database initialization

* `rails db:drop db:create db:migrate db:seed`

### How to run the test suite

* Coming soonish

### Services

* Coming later

### Deployment instructions

* Coming later

### Collaboration

* Work on a branch that corresponds with an issue filed on this repository, and has your name in it.  (For example: `feature-1-andy-my-awesome-feature`).
* Try to make one commit per logical unit of work.
* Try to use descriptive commit messages.
* Push your branch to GitHub and submit a pull request.
* Say which issue the pull request [closes](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/) in the body of your pull request.
* Request a code review from one of this repository's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/orgs/wyncode/teams/codeowners/members).

### Code Formatting

* Tabs are really two spaces.
* Each file should end with a newline.
* Use proper indentation.
* Don't add or remove whitespace without a well thought-out reason.
